By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block. 

1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes

<repeat>
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
<repeat-x>
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).
repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically
only.
<no-repeat>
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. It
can have one of two values:
<fixed>
The background image stays in
the same position on the page.
<scroll>
The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.


X You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
X Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
X You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
X Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
X You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
X To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

1: Page Title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the <title> element which lives
inside the <head> element.
2: URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.
3: Headings
If the keywords are in a heading
<hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.
4: Text
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.
5: Link Text
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").
6: Image Alt Text
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.
7: Page Descriptions
The description also lives inside
the <head> element and is
specified using a <meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)
