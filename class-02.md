**what is html pages**
# HTML pages are text documents.
**why is the tags used for**
# HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
*like ● Structural markup:<head>*
*like ● Semantic markup: <main>*
**for ex : <head> what is the type of this tag and where we can use ?**
**the type of this tag is structural tag and only contain the baisc name or title etc**
# Tags are often referred to as elements.
# Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
# Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
# Attributes require a name and a value.
# To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

**Introducing CSS**
# Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to the web.
# Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.
# HTML5 introduces new <video> and <audio> elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but these are only supported in the latest browsers.
# Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not all support the same video and audio formats, so you need to supply your files in different formats to ensure that everyone can see/hear them.
