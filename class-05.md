# The <h1> element is used with an id attribute at the top of the page so that a link can be added to take readers from the bottom of the page to the top. 
# Links are created using the <a> element.
# The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
# If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
# You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
# You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
# There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more attractive and professional. In this chapter you will learn how to:
*Include an image in your web pages using HTML*
*Pick which image format to use*
*Show an image at the right size*
*Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster*
 # <img>
 *To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:*
# src
*This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.*
# alt
*This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.*
# title
*You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.*
# Serif
**Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs. In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read. Sans-Serif Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.**
# Screens
**screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.**
# Monospace
**Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.) Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow.**
