#(body>
You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.
<head>
Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.
<title>
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time)

#SIZE
Larger elements will grab users'
attention first. For this reason it
is a good idea to make headings
and key points relatively large.
#COLOR
Foreground and background
color can draw attention to key
messages. Brighter sections tend
to draw users' attention first.
#Style
An element may be the same
size and color as surrounding
content but have a different style
applied to it to make it stand out.
