# float 
*The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.*
# z-index
*When you use relative, fixed, or
absolute positioning, boxes can
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the
HTML code sit on top of those
that are earlier in the page*
# position:fixed
*Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.*
# position:absolute 
*When the position property
is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page. (They act like it is not
there*
# position:relative 
*Relative positioning moves an
element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow*

# clear
The clear property allows you
to say that no element (within
the same containing element)
should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take
the following values:
left
The left-hand side of the box
should not touch any other
elements appearing in the same
containing element.
right
The right-hand side of the
box will not touch elements
appearing in the same containing
element.
both
Neither the left nor right-hand
sides of the box will touch
elements appearing in the same
containing element.
none
Elements can touch either side
#  <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
# Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
# The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
# Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
# Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
# Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
# CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
# You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
