# <dl>
*The definition list is created with*
*the <dl> element and usually*
*consists of a series of terms and*
*their definitions.*
*Inside the <dl> element you will*
*usually see pairs of <dt> and*
*<dd> elements.*
# <dt>

# <dd>

#  There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
# Ordered lists use numbers.
# Unordered lists use bullets.
# Definition lists are used to define terminology.
# Lists can be nested inside one another.
# X In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
# List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
# Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
# Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
# Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

# • A variable called sign holds the text the sign will show.
 # • A property called length is used to determine how many characters are in the string. 
 # A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
# Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be rememberedbefore creating a calculation using that value.
# Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
# Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
# JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
# Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value
